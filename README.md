# Data Engineering Mini Project 3
## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to use the previous template and polars to analyze a dataset, obtain its summary statistics and visualization. The dataset used here is the "cereal" dataset, which contains statistics of different cereal brands, including calories, ratings, weight, etc.
 
## Steps
1. Add python to requirement.txt
2. In main.py, define two functions. One returns the summary statistics and the other visualizes the data.
3. Add test cases in test_main.py.  

## Check format and test
Use make test command to test the code

Use make lint and format command to check the format
